# flask
 A simple telegram bot with blockchain, to store and get data. It stores data that post from the web site(just a simple html and bootstrap),then sends the file for python back-end, that encrypts the data by AES and RSA, and finally, without saving the key, it transmites for telegram bot. So admins have no access for the files. Also it addes hash function of the previous file for the last line of the current file, in order to provide block secure storing method. So, changing something in one of the files, will destroy it totally, and show for the users, which file exactly was modified. In order to receive your file back, you just need to send for telegram bot your file number(block number) + AES decrypting key and file format (jpg,doc,mp4,avi, etc)
Also as a bonus, it have currency parser. It parses the data from Russian Federation national banks's site, than transimtes it for python in order to convert it for Kazakhstan currency and than send's it back for web site and telegram bot if required
